MAP PARSING NOTES

-Map must be surrounded by walls.
-There can be islands
-can textures be opaque? pixels be opaque? can there be see-through wall etc?


- put 1s to empty spaces when parsing


RAYCASTING NOTES

The flag (-O3 -ffast-math) is used for optimization.

TO DO:
- flag or a way to know which direction player starts in

TO FIX:

- ray jumps weirdly when moving
- first rotation jumps the ray and the angle, but only if start pos other than north
- ray angle is more than player angle (should be less)
