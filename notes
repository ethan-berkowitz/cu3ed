-Map must be surrounded by walls. No two different sections?
-in map.cub, do N E W S need to be in the same order as pdf??
-can textures be opaque? pixels be opaque? can there be see-through wall etc?


- put 1s to empty spaces when parsing


RAYCASTING NOTES

The flag (-O3 -ffast-math) is used for optimization.

TO FIX:

- ray goes thru the wall
- ray doesnt always find the wall
- ray jumps weirdly?
- all these result in wall_check getting weird numbers and causing segfault
- ray angle not resetting properly
- draw line not starting from the front?
- depending on player angle, either up/left or down/right movements happen in an angle
- starting position/rotation sometimes angled (might be related to the problem above)
