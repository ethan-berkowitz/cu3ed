MAP PARSING NOTES

-Map must be surrounded by walls.
-There can be islands
-can textures be opaque? pixels be opaque? can there be see-through wall etc?


- put 1s to empty spaces when parsing


RAYCASTING NOTES

The flag (-O3 -ffast-math) is used for optimization.

TO DO:
- rename draw-line functions to be more clearly about minimap
- make a faster put_pixel by modifying mlx_image_t pixel data directly
- we need set_pixel function to make transparent pixels, since mlx_image only accepts uint8, without alpha channel.
-> but this can be fixed/circumvented with a separate function to modify pixel data

TO FIX:
- movement still angled
