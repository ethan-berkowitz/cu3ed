MAP PARSING NOTES

TO DO:
- map scaling
- more map parsing tests
- norminette
- valgrind
- malloc checks

RAYCASTING NOTES

The flag (-O3 -ffast-math) is used for optimization.

TO DO:
- make a faster put_pixel by modifying mlx_image_t pixel data directly?
- bobbing motion to animation when walking (up/down)
- move zippo left/right when rotating
- separate bonus stuff to its files, add make bonus
- ADD DOCUMENTATION/COMMENTS
- scale minimap, add background to it

TO FIX:
- program slows down as it runs!
