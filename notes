MAP PARSING NOTES

-Map must be surrounded by walls.
-There can be islands
-can textures be opaque? pixels be opaque? can there be see-through wall etc?


- put 1s to empty spaces when parsing


RAYCASTING NOTES

The flag (-O3 -ffast-math) is used for optimization.

TO DO:
- rename draw-line functions to be more clearly about minimap
- make a faster put_pixel by modifying mlx_image_t pixel data directly?
- RGB needs to be single variable


TO FIX:
- movement still angled
- issue is starting direction is anything except north. not starting in the map???
- program slows down as it runs! 
- minimap on top works, but i would like it to be a bit transparent, meaning that we would have to find a new solution (draw it last)
