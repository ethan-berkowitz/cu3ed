MAP PARSING NOTES

-Map must be surrounded by walls.
-There can be islands
-can textures be opaque? pixels be opaque? can there be see-through wall etc?


RAYCASTING NOTES

Rotation Update — it is resolved based on the current direction and rotation speed.
Forward/Backward Movements — it is resolved based on the current position of the player, 
rotation angle and the up and down direction.
Left & Right Movements — it is resolved by adding the new angle rotation angle + (pi / 2), 
and the left and right direction.

Pythagora's theorem: a^2 + b^2 = c^2
We need to find the value of c, where c is the distance between two points A(a,0) and B(0,b) on a 2D plane. 
The formula to find c is c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2). 

The flag (-O3 -ffast-math) is used for optimization.
