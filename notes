MAP PARSING NOTES

-Map must be surrounded by walls.
-There can be islands
-can textures be opaque? pixels be opaque? can there be see-through wall etc?


- put 1s to empty spaces when parsing


RAYCASTING NOTES

The flag (-O3 -ffast-math) is used for optimization.

TO DO:
- make a faster put_pixel by modifying mlx_image_t pixel data directly?
- take rgb values from the map file
- bobbing motion to animation when walking (up/down)
- move zippo left/right when rotating
- separate bonus stuff to its files, add make bonus

TO FIX:
- program slows down as it runs!
